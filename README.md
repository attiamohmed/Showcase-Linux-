# Showcase Linux Repository

This GitHub repository, "Showcase Linux," contains two Bash scripts designed for use on Linux systems. These scripts provide practical functionality and system information reporting:

## Scripts

### 1. BMI Calculator

The "BMI Calculator" script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height values. It categorizes the BMI into different categories, including Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obesity. This script is useful for anyone interested in monitoring their health and fitness.

### 2. System Info Report

The "System Info Report" script collects essential system information, such as hostname, operating system, CPU details, memory utilization, and disk usage. It then logs this information to a file, checks for CPU load, memory usage, and disk usage, and provides warnings if these metrics exceed predefined thresholds. Additionally, the script can create a compressed archive of the log file for easy storage and sharing.

## Usage

## Usage
